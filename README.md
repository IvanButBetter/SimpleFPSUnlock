# SimpleFPSUnlock
My own FPS Unlocker.
## How it works
It finds the folder where your roblox client is stored. Then, it adds a setting to make the desired fps 144. Its pretty simple ngl
# MANDATORY FILES

The python file is the only truly mandatory file, as the script can create the json file. HOWEVER, if you opt to not use the .bat file, you **HAVE TO CD TO THE DIRECTORY OF THE SCRIPT AND THEN RUN `python FPSUNLOCK.py` FOR IT TO WORK. I RECOMMEND USING THE .bat FILE TO AVOID THIS**. The .bat file requires admin priveleges due to the roblox folders being protected.
